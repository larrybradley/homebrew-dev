============
Misc [Homebrew][1] formulae.


How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap larrybradley/dev` or `brew tap larrybradley/homebrew-dev` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from `mxcl/master` or another tap, you can `brew install larrybradley/dev/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

`brew install https://raw.github.com/larrybradley/homebrew-dev/master/<formula>.rb`
